# codacy-test

1. Fork this repository
2. Import into [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/projects)
3. Try to get both JavaScript files included in the analysis

It looks like this isn't working, see https://www.codacy.com/app/markseu/codacy-test

`webinterface.js` = is ignored  
`zzz-test-codacy.js` = works fine
